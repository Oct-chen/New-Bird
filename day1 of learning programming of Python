#Fibonacci in simple code
a, b = 0,1  #多变量赋值时，只需将不同变量以及要赋的值用逗号按顺序隔开即可
While b < 10000:
    print(b, end="")    #关键词end的使用可以将结果输出到同一行
    a, b = b, a + b
'''The first row contains a Multivariable assignment.And finally a gets the number 0 and b gets 1.
The last row is same as the first action.
The code a, b = b, a + b is equivalent to b = n; a + b = m; a = n; b = m.Thus you can understand it clearly

#Maybe we can coding the Fibonacci in another way in recurrence
n = int(input())
def fab(n):
    if n < 1:
        print("输入错误")
        return -1
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return fab(n-1) + fab(n-2)
print(fab(n))

This programming is different from the former, which output the final result.And because of the recurrence, it will occupy a large
number of the RAM.
